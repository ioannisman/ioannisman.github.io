The following is a list of publications which I have co-authored, and were presented in journals, conferences, workshops, etc.
All the publications follow the *Theoretical Computer Science convention*, where the authors are listed in alphabetical order.
There might be some *"overlap"*, e.g., a *(short)* workshop paper might later extend and appear as a *(full)* conference paper.
