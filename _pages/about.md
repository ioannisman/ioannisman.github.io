<div style="text-align: justify">  
Grown up in the beautiful town of Chalkida, I came to study Computer Science, and oddly enough (?) to enjoy it.
So, after completing my undergraduate studies in Athens, and my graduate studies in Nice, I moved to Lugano, in Ticino, the italian-speaking part of Switzerland.
I am currently pursuing a PhD degree at Università della Svizzera italiana (USI), in the <a href="http://compgeom.inf.usi.ch">group of Prof. Papadopoulou</a>, and I spend most of my time doing research.
My main research interest lies in algorithm design with a focus on Computational Geometry.
In simple terms, I like to find efficient solutions for Computer Science related problems, which usually have some geometric twist.
When I don't work or travel, you will find me around Ticino enjoying the mountains, some wine or some polenta!<br>

Following, there is a short description of my education and work experience.
There is also a list of my <a href="https://ioannisman.github.io/publications/">publications</a>, my <a href="https://ioannisman.github.io/talks/">talks</a> and my <a href="https://ioannisman.github.io/teaching/">teaching activities</a>.
