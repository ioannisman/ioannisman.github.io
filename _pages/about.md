<div style="text-align: justify">
<p>
Grown up in the beautiful town of Chalkida, I came to study Computer Science and (eventually) became genuinely passionate about it.
After completing my undergraduate studies at the <a href="https://www.di.uoa.gr/en">University of Athens</a>, Greece, and my graduate studies at <a href="https://polytech.univ-cotedazur.eu/">Polytech Nice</a>, France, I moved to Lugano, in Ticino, Switzerland.
There, I spent several years doing research at <a href="https://www.usi.ch/en">Università della Svizzera italiana</a>, where I was awarded a PhD degree.
After that, I spent a few years in St. Gallen working as an R&D Software Engineer at <a href="https://leica-geosystems.com">Leica Geosystems</a>, focusing mainly on software engineering and building reliable systems.
Currently, I live in Zurich, Switzerland, where I work as an R&D Engineer at <a href="https://www.planlabs.com">Planlabs</a>, focusing on algorithm development and turning optimization ideas into practical, scalable solutions.
</p>

<p>
At work, I'm currently part of a small cross-functional startup team at Planlabs, building an automated design platform for building technology planning—my focus is efficient algorithm development and scalable software engineering for optimized, reliable solutions.
In my free time, you can also find me tackling algorithmic and optimization challenges—sometimes as small research explorations, sometimes as hands-on real-world problem solving.
</p>

<p>
Beyond engineering, I enjoy staying active and exploring new places. I love hiking, kayaking, and traveling in general, and I've been involved in sports for many years.
I also enjoy participating in—and sometimes organizing—community and social initiatives.
</p>

<p>
Following, there is a short description of my education and work experience.
There is also a list of my <a href="https://ioannisman.github.io/publications/">publications</a>, and my <a href="https://ioannisman.github.io/talks/">talks</a> and <a href="https://ioannisman.github.io/teaching/">teaching activities</a> related with my stay as a PhD candidate at USI.
You can also read my <a href="https://ioannisman.github.io/news/">latest news</a> which I try to keep up to date!
