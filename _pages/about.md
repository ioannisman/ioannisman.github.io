Grown up in the beautiful town of Chalkida, I came to study Computer Science, and oddly enough (?) to enjoy it.
So, after completing my undergraduate studies in Athens, and my graduate studies in Nice, I moved to Lugano, in Ticino, the italian-speaking part of Switzerland.
I am currently pursuing a PhD degree at Università della Svizzera italiana (USI), in the <a href="http://compgeom.inf.usi.ch">group of Prof. Papadopoulou</a>, and I spend most of my time doing research.
My main research interest lies in algorithm design with a focus on Computational Geometry.
In simple terms, I like to find efficient solutions for Computer Science related problems, which usually have some geometric twist.
When I don't work or travel, you will find me around Ticino enjoying the mountains, some wine or some polenta!<br>-->
Grown up in the beautiful town of Chalkida, I came to study Computer Science, and to somehow enjoy it.
So, after completing my undergraduate studies in Athens, and my graduate studies in Nice, I moved to Lugano, in Ticino, the italian-speaking part of Switzerland.
There I spent a few years doing research at Università della Svizzera italiana (USI), for which I was recently awarded a PhD degree.
After the PhD, I joined the Hellenic Army to fulfill my military obligations, compulsory for all Greek nationals.
I am going to be serving in the Army until the coming September, when I am planning to set off for new adventures.

<br>
Research-wise my main interest lies in algorithm design, that is, to come up with efficient solutions for Computer Science related problems.
I am particularly keen on problems having some geometric twist and optimization problems.

Following, there is a short description of my education and work experience.
There is also a list of my <a href="https://ioannisman.github.io/publications/">publications</a>, and my <a href="https://ioannisman.github.io/talks/">talks</a> and <a href="https://ioannisman.github.io/teaching/">teaching activities</a> related with my stay as a PhD candidate at USI.
Oh, you can also read my <a href="https://ioannisman.github.io/news/">latest news</a> which I try to keep up to date!<br>
